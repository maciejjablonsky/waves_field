# Waves

[![Build msvc](https://github.com/maciejjablonsky/waves_field/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg?branch=vulkan)](https://github.com/maciejjablonsky/waves_field/actions/workflows/build.yml)

It's my hobby project where I learn 3d graphics (firstly with OpenGL, then I'd like to switch to Vulkan).

The goal is to create realistic sea simulation, with some marine life beneath the surface and above.
